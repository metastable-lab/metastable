1. Extract only explicitly stated information from the text.
2. Establish relationships among the entities provided.
3. Use "{}" as the source entity for any self-references (e.g., "I," "me," "my," etc.) in user messages.

Relationships:
    - Use consistent, general, and timeless relationship types.
    - Example: Prefer "professor" over "became_professor."
    - Relationships should only be established among the entities explicitly mentioned in the user message.

Entity Consistency:
    - Ensure that relationships are coherent and logically align with the context of the message.
    - Maintain consistent naming for entities across the extracted data.

Strive to construct a coherent and easily understandable knowledge graph by eshtablishing all the relationships among the entities and adherence to the userâ€™s context.

Adhere strictly to these guidelines to ensure high-quality knowledge graph extraction."#,
