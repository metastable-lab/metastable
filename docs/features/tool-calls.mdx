## Overview

Tool Calls extend the capabilities of AI agents by enabling them to interact with external APIs, perform calculations, fetch real-time data, and execute custom commands. This feature makes AI agents more functional and adaptable to various use cases.

## Features

### 1. Built-in Tool Integration
- Access a library of predefined tools for common tasks
- Seamless integration with third-party services (e.g., weather APIs, financial data sources)
- Real-time data retrieval and processing

### 2. Custom Tool Development
- Define your own tool functions with specific parameters
- Secure API authentication and data access control
- Enable complex workflows through multi-step tool calls

### 3. API Interactions
- Connect AI agents with RESTful APIs for seamless data exchange
- Handle JSON responses and extract relevant information
- Automate workflows by integrating with existing systems

### 4. Real-Time Data Processing
- AI agents analyze and interpret live data inputs
- Dynamic decision-making based on incoming information
- Process and transform structured and unstructured data

## How to Create Your Own Tool Calls

1. **Define the Tool**
   - Create a tool function with the necessary parameters

2. **Register the Tool**
   - Add the tool to the AI agent's capability list

3. **Enable API Access**
